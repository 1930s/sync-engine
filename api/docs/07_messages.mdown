Title: Messages

Messages are a sub-object of threads. The content of a message is immutable (with the exception being [drafts](#drafts)). Inbox does not support operations such as move or delete on individual messagesâ€”those operations should be performed on the message's thread. All messages are part of a thread, even if that thread has only one message.

Fetch a list of messages matching the criteria specified.

    GET  https://api.inboxapp.com/account_id/messages/<message_id>

**Options:**

* This API supports the query parameters documented below, making it easy to return a subset of messages matching your needs. In most cases, you should specify one or more query parameters to return messages in a specific folder, from a specific sender, etc.
* Include `?body=1` to include the message body in the response.

TODO include BCC?

Note: if one of the user's email address is not present in the `to` field, then the message was either BCC'd to them, or copied into their mailbox by another means.
