Title: Sending

In order to send a message, it must first be created as a draft message. There is no direct API call for sending a message that is not already a draft. See [Drafts](#drafts) for more details on creating draft messages.

If a message has the `draft` tag, then it can be sent by simply applying the `send` tag via the [Tag API](#tags). Inbox will detect this specific change, remove the `draft` tag, and send the message through the user's mail provider.

During the process of sending a message through provider's gateway, the message will have the `sending` tag. After it has successfuly sent, the message will have the `sent` tag. Usually this process happens very quickly. If you notice messages that continue to have the `sending` tag, you should check the status of the [namespace](#namespaces).

Applying the `send` tag to messages without the `draft` tag will fail and have no effect on the message.
