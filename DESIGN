* On the browser-side, use angular for all of the DOM manipulation.
* Design a wire protocol for updating about message changes, etc. - backend
  will synchronize data with socketio.
* Tornado is just useful right now for getting something you can see; we don't
  want e.g. the templating in the end.
* Backend should be all python 3? (problem: imapclient is python2-only)

ORGANIZATION:
- crispin module: all the IMAP functionality (wrapping an imaplib wrapper o.O)
  - really a few different parts:
    - initial mail download
    - other IMAP commands
    - IMAP IDLE
- a websockets process that synchronizes data with the client
  - brubeck / diesel?
- app.py: temporary Tornado backend
