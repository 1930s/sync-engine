Messaging is largely context based.

This is why there are several apps like iMessages, FB, Path, WhatsApp, Line, OKCupid, and so on which have messaging components that are essentially identical aside from the visual treatment.

Under the hood, they all have the same data model and mechanisms. To, from, send, receive, etc.

Nerds want these to be "unified" but the separation of context is really important.

Context-based messaging will only become more important as time goes on.

Every app, every game, and every place should have a messaging component. 

Communication makes everything better.


INBOX KIT

a framework for mobile devices that allows them to immediately add messaging capabilities, with support for authentication and push notification.

These messages show up in the app with some mostly-unified view, but also can show up in the Inbox app. You can send from either. (Like FB messages and the FB app.)

SDK contains: hook for push notifications, message composer, banner notifications, message list view, thread view. 

Open API to get notifications as a web server. Streaming. Look into Twitter firehose api for this.

APIs for adding payloads (images, videos) to messages. Add from your "library".
