find your own rhythm.

     work five days a week. any five days. average that over the long run,
     not the short.

     the 5-days-on, 2-days off work week is a holdover from the days of the
     industrial revolution, and it just doesn't make sense anymore for
     creators.

     taking advantage of a mid-week sunny day to go rock climbing, or a windy
     day to go kiting can make a huge difference in personal happiness and
     motivation! why should we sigh that it'll rain all weekend and that's our
     only time off?

     we take breaks when we need them. and if we're on a roll, we don't stop
     just because it's saturday.


live in the world.

     work-provided lunch is okay, but we'll never provide dinner. go out.
     go home. see your friends and family. look at some art. live!

no more mama company.

     you're a grown up. do your own laundry.
